# In-Memory file System
This project implements an in-memory file system that replicates essential file management operations within a computer's RAM.

# Supported Commads
mkdir: Create a new directory.
cd: Changes the current directory. Support navigating to the parent directory using .., moving to the root directory using /, and navigating to a specified absolute path. Basically anything that you can do in a normal terminal. Since there is no user level implementation, ~ and / should take you to root.
ls: List the contents of the current directory or a specified directory.
grep: Search for a specified pattern in a file. PS: Its a bonus
cat: Display the contents of a file.
touch: Create a new empty file.
echo: Write text to a file. ex - echo 'I am "Finding" difficult to write this to file' > file.txt
mv: Move a file or directory to another location. ex - mv /data/ice_cream/cassata.txt ./data/boring/ice_cream/mississippimudpie/
cp: Copy a file or directory to another location. ex - cp /data/ice_cream/cassata.txt . **. For current directory **
rm: Remove a file or directory.
